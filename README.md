# AI Code Generator with RAG

A sophisticated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered code generation application that leverages Google's Vertex AI Gemini 2.0 Flash model to provide intelligent, context-aware code generation based on best practices and domain-specific knowledge.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This application combines the power of modern AI with enterprise-grade vector search to generate high-quality code snippets, complete projects, and technical solutions. It uses a RAG architecture to retrieve relevant coding best practices and guidelines before generating responses, ensuring accurate and contextually appropriate code.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

- **FastAPI Web Application (`main.py`)**: RESTful API server with web interface  
- **RAG Code Generator (`generator.py`)**: Core engine combining vector search with AI generation  
- **Knowledge Base Builder (`build_knowledge_base.py`)**: Utility to create and manage the vector knowledge base  
- **Web Interface**: Clean, responsive frontend for user interaction  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

### Core Stack

- **Python 3.8+** – Main programming language  
- **FastAPI** – High-performance web framework  
- **Uvicorn** – ASGI server for FastAPI apps  

### AI & Machine Learning

- **Google Vertex AI** – Managed AI model hosting and execution  
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite** – Multimodal code generation model  
- **Text Embedding Model (`text-embedding-005`)** – Embedding engine for semantic retrieval  

### Vector Search & Retrieval

- **FAISS** – High-speed vector similarity search  
- **NumPy** – Efficient numerical computations for embeddings  

### Cloud Infrastructure

- **Google Cloud Storage** – Persistent object storage for knowledge base  
- **Google Cloud AI Platform** – Deployment and orchestration for AI models  

### Frontend Technologies

- **HTML5/CSS3** – Markup and styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Frontend interactivity  
- **Responsive Design** – Mobile-optimized user experience
